Currently your Arduino can only beep like a microwave oven. Mozzi brings
your Arduino to life by allowing it to produce much more complex and interesting growls, sweeps and chorusing atmospherics. These sounds can be quickly and easily constructed from familiar synthesis units like oscillators, delays, filters and envelopes.

You can use Mozzi to generate algorithmic music for an installation or
performance, or make interactive sonifications of sensors, on a small, modular and super cheap Arduino, without the need for additional shields, message passing or external synths.

Here are some sounds of the example sketches which come with Mozzi:

***

Using a "Line" to sweep frequency:

## Features
-    Available for a wide and growing range of MCUs, with and without inbuilt DACs: Arduino Uno R3 and R4, STM32, Teensy, ESP8266, ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, and more.
-    Configurable sample rate, usually in powers of two (16384 Hz, 32768 Hz, 64536 Ht).
-    Variable control rate from 64 Hz upwards.
-    Various inbuilt output modes, including 16 bit output to an external DAC.
-    Allows interfacing to custom output routines, with examples for playing audio on external DAC modules, and even bluetooth.
-    Useful basic audio toolkit: oscillators, samples, lines, envelopes, scheduling, filtering.
-    Fast ADC and other cpu-efficient code utilities to help keep audio running smoothly.
-    Example sketches for easy modification.
-    Readymade wavetables and a script to convert your own soundfiles for Mozzi.
-    Mozzi is designed to be easy to use, open source and extendable.

## Installation
The easiest installation option nowadays is to install Mozzi via the Library Manager in your Arduino application:
_Arduino➞Sketch➞Include Library➞Library Manager_ type "Mozzi" into the search field, then click "install".

For other installation methods (e.g. the development version), see the [Download page](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/download).

## Quick Start
To hear Mozzi, wire a 3.5mm audio jack with the centre to the audio out pin for your Arduino as shown in the table below, and the shield to GND on the Arduino.
Plug into your computer and listen with a sound program like [Audacity](https://audacity.sourceforge.net/). (Or connect any other high-impedance input, like an active speaker)
Try some examples from the __File > Examples > Mozzi__ menu.

For more about audio output, including high quality output modes [Mozzi Output tutorial](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/output/).

## Using Mozzi
Here's a template for an empty Mozzi sketch:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <Mozzi.h>   // at the top of your sketch

void setup() {
	startMozzi();
}

void updateControl(){
	// your control code
}

AudioOutput_t updateAudio(){
	MonoOutput::from16Bit( [my_cool_sample] );
}

void loop() {
	audioHook();
}
{% endhighlight %}

There's a detailed example explaining the different parts [here](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/a-simple-sketch/).


## Documentation

For getting started, browse the practical help on the [learn](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/learn/) page on the Mozzi site.  
API reference documentation is available in the doc folder in the Mozzi download and [online](http://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html).  
Start or look up a topic on the [users forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozzi-users/).  
Also, feel free to submit any issues on the [GitHub Mozzi site](https://github.com/sensorium/Mozzi/issues/).  
Look for code and usage changes [here](extras/NEWS.txt).  
For hardware specific details, including supported features, caveats, and hardware-dependent configuration options,
refer to the [Hardware Section of the API-Documentation](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/hardware.html).

## Compatibiliy issues

* In most setups, Mozzi claims one or two hardware timers. This may result in incompatibilities with certain libraries, and / or the ability to use timer-based functions such as `analogWrite()`. As the details on this
  differ a lot between the supported boards, read up on the details - and available workarounds - in the [ardware Section of the API-Documentation](https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/hardware.html).

* There is also an example on emulating `analogWrite()` on any digitial pin in *Mozzi>examples>11.Communication>Sinewave_PWM_pins_HIFI*.

* The timers can be made available with `stopMozzi()`, which stops audio interrupts, until you call `startMozzi()`.

## Contributions / Included Dependencies
Modified versions of the following libraries are included in the Mozzi download:  

[TimerOne library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_TimerOne.html)
